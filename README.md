# üõ°Ô∏è SIEM Lite ‚Äì Threat Detection & Incident Response

## Overview
SIEM Lite will be a powerful security tool designed to collect and analyze logs from various devices to detect cyber threats.  
It will help users find attacks like brute-force logins, port scans, suspicious commands, and more, while keeping the design simple but open for future improvements.

## Objective
- Collect and centralize security logs from Linux, Windows, firewalls, IDS, and other sources.  
- Correlate events across devices to uncover multi-step attacks.  
- Send real-time alerts for suspicious activity.  
- Provide tools for in-depth investigations and threat hunting.  
- Generate detailed incident reports and timelines.  
- Automate incident responses for faster containment.  
- Support scalable, multi-tenant environments with access control.

## Planned Features

### Core Detection & Monitoring
- Log ingestion from syslog, Windows Event Logs, firewalls, IDS/IPS.  
- Rule-based detections for brute-force, port scans, malicious commands, data exfiltration, and malware beaconing.  
- IOC matching against threat intelligence feeds (Abuse.ch, MISP, AlienVault OTX).

### Possible Additions
- Anomaly detection using machine learning/statistical models to spot unknown threats.  
- Full MITRE ATT&CK framework integration to map detections to attacker behaviors.  
- Scalable, distributed architecture for real-time, high-volume log processing.  
- Automated incident response playbooks that interact with firewalls and endpoint tools.  
- Threat intelligence fusion with scoring and enrichment (WHOIS, geolocation).  
- Forensics modules preserving tamper-proof logs and evidence for compliance.  
- User Behavior Analytics to detect insider threats based on activity patterns.  
- Interactive, real-time dashboards with drill-downs and customizable queries.  
- Multi-tenant support with role-based access control and audit trails.  
- Powerful query language for deep threat hunting and ad-hoc searches.

## Technologies (Future Stack)
- Log collectors like Syslog-ng, Winlogbeat, Filebeat  
- Python for detection engines, machine learning, and automation  
- Scalable storage with Elasticsearch clusters or time-series databases  
- Web dashboard using Kibana or custom Flask/React apps  
- Threat intelligence via APIs and automated feeds  
- Alerting through email, Slack, Discord, or other webhooks  
- Message queues (Kafka/RabbitMQ) for distributed log processing

## Example Detection Scenarios
- More than 5 failed SSH logins from one IP in 1 minute  
- Multiple port connections within 10 seconds (port scan)  
- Base64 PowerShell command execution  
- Large outbound data transfers to suspicious IPs  
- Regular connections to known malicious hosts (malware beaconing)

## Use Cases
- Training and simulation environments for security teams  
- Small to medium businesses needing affordable, scalable security monitoring  
- Cybersecurity competitions and hands-on learning labs  
- Real-world SOC operations with automated response capabilities
