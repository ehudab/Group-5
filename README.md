## 📌 Overview
**Seed Guard** is a **blockchain-powered, AI-enhanced, IoT-enabled** platform built to secure Ethiopia’s seed supply chain — from breeding to harvest — while preserving indigenous seed varieties.  
It combats threats such as **counterfeit seeds, genetic data theft, supply chain tampering, and data loss**.

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- **Counterfeit Prevention** – Detect fake seeds using AI-powered packaging verification.  
- **Blockchain Traceability** – Provide immutable records for seed batches.  
- **Genetic Data Protection** – Secure indigenous seed data with encryption & access control.  
- **IoT Monitoring** – Track storage & transport conditions in real time.  
- **Farmer Empowerment** – Allow instant mobile verification of seed authenticity.  

---

## 🚜 Background
Agriculture is Ethiopia’s economic backbone.  
Seeds — especially indigenous varieties — are **protected under the Ethiopian Constitution (Article 40)** as part of farmers’ rights to own and control natural resources.

### Current Challenges
- ❌ Counterfeit & low-quality seeds reduce yields  
- 📜 Paper-based certification prone to forgery  
- 🔍 Poor traceability in storage & distribution  
- 🔒 Vulnerable to cyber-attacks & data loss  

---

## ⚖ Constitutional Alignment
Seed Guard supports Ethiopian constitutional principles by:
- 🛡 **Protecting Farmers’ Rights** – Digitally securing seed ownership & provenance  
- 🌾 **Preserving Heritage** – Safeguarding indigenous seed data from theft or loss  
- 🍽 **Promoting Food Security** – Improving crop yields through quality assurance  
- 📲 **Empowering Farmers** – Tools to verify authenticity before planting  
- 🤝 **Respecting Traditions** – Integrating with existing seed exchange systems  

---

## 🛠 Current Seed Market (Problems)
- Production mainly by government institutions & private breeders  
- Certification is **manual & forgeable**  
- Storage lacks **environmental monitoring**  
- Farmers rely on **trust** when buying seeds from informal markets  
- Fragmented records hinder **traceability & enforcement**  

---

## 💡 Seed Guard’s Solution
1. **Digital Seed Passport (DSP)** – Blockchain-secured certificates replacing paper labels  
2. **Blockchain Ledger** – Tamper-proof records for every seed batch  
3. **AI Verification** – Image recognition for counterfeit detection  
4. **IoT Tracking** – Temperature, humidity, and location sensors  
5. **Encrypted Data Storage** – AES-256 + MFA + TLS 1.3 security stack  
6. **Cyber Threat Alerts** – Integrated SIEM alerts via SMS/email  

---

## 👥 Target Users
- Ministry of Agriculture  
- Seed research centers & genetic labs  
- Farmer cooperatives & unions  
- Customs/import-export authorities  
- NGOs for indigenous seed preservation  

---

## 🖥 Technology Stack
- **Backend:** Django / Node.js  
- **Blockchain:** Hyperledger Fabric / Ethereum private network  
- **AI:** TensorFlow / PyTorch  
- **Security:** AES-256 encryption, MFA, TLS 1.3  
- **IoT:** Raspberry Pi + RFID + MQTT
